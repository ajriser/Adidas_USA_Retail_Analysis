# Adidas_USA_Retail_Analysis
## Overview
This repository documents my independent analytics project, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset featuring over 1500+ Adidas fashion products. The primary focus of this work was to extract demographic-specific product preferences and to understand the impact of pricing strategies on consumer purchasing behavior.

##Key accomplishments include:

1. Establishing a novel weighted rating score by integrating average ratings with review counts, providing a comprehensive measure of customer feedback.
2. Performing product affinity analysis and price band segmentation using the 'breadcrumbs' data field to illustrate patterns in customer product navigation and purchasing decisions.

The insights gained from this project have informed the development of data-driven product strategies and refined marketing approaches, laying the groundwork for enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction. The repository includes detailed documentation, code, and visualizations that showcase the methodologies and findings of this thorough analysis

# Adidas_USA_Retail_Analysis
## Overview
This repository documents my independent analytics project, where I conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset featuring over 1500+ Adidas fashion products. The primary focus of this work was to extract demographic-specific product preferences and to understand the impact of pricing strategies on consumer purchasing behavior.

Key accomplishments include:

1. Establishing a novel weighted rating score by integrating average ratings with review counts, providing a comprehensive measure of customer feedback.
2. Performing product affinity analysis and price band segmentation using the 'breadcrumbs' data field to illustrate patterns in customer product navigation and purchasing decisions.

Few findings from the dataset:

1. White shoes are the most popular product on the platform, followed by black and blue shoes​​.
2. Multicolor and white are the most preferred colors for accessories, while gold-colored clothing is the least popular​​.
3. The Shoes category exhibits a broader profit margin range compared to Accessories and Clothing, indicating different pricing strategies across categories​​.
4. The newly introduced "Weighted Rating Score" considers both the average rating and the number of reviews, providing a balanced measure of product reputation​​.
5. The visualizations show a non-linear relationship between the average rating and the adjusted weighted rating score, factoring in the number of reviews to moderate the score​​.
6. The majority of products fall within the price band of USD $0-$50, suggesting a concentration in the lower price segment​​.
7. There's a cluster of shoe products with high review counts, yet some of these popular items do not rate as highly in terms of customer satisfaction​​.
8. Products with a larger number of reviews have an adjusted weighted rating that tends to normalize towards a median range, regardless of the average rating​​.
10. Most products are found in the women/clothing category, followed by men/shoes, which could be useful for visualizing customer paths and preferences​​.

And here are the top recommendations for the business:

1. Utilize the "Weighted Rating Score" to refine marketing strategies, highlighting products with high scores to enhance consumer trust and satisfaction​​.
2. Consider focusing marketing and stock on the most popular colors for each category, especially targeting white for shoes and multicolor for accessories​​.
3. Evaluate pricing strategies to enhance profitability, particularly within the Shoes category where there is more variability and potential for increased margins​​.
4. Leverage the concentration of products in the lower price band to attract price-sensitive customers while exploring opportunities in higher price segments​​.
5. Assess the potential for review quantity to skew perceived quality and adjust product listings and promotions accordingly, ensuring that high-quality items with fewer reviews are adequately highlighted​​.
6. Enhance the Product Affinity Analysis by incorporating actual user navigation patterns, which could provide deeper insights into customer behavior and preferences​​.
7. Combine the dataset with official Adidas customer data to gain a comprehensive understanding of eCommerce and retail trends, enabling more targeted marketing and product development strategies​​.
8. Develop network graphs or Sankey diagrams to illustrate how customers move between product categories, informing UX/UI design and category management​​.

The insights gained from this project can lead to the development of data-driven product strategies and refined marketing approaches, laying the groundwork for enhanced customer engagement and satisfaction.
